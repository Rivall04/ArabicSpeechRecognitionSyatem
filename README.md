# ArabicSpeechRecognitionSystem
We build this system to teach how to pronounce Arabic phonemes correctly and effectively. 
For sure, there were many difficulties and the small dataset we had to feed to the CNN model caused the model to be overloaded 
The next and most advanced model will publish soon.
Thank you for reading to this line.
